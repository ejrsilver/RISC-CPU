# RISC-CPU

The purpose of this project is to design, simulate, implement, and verify a simple computer (Mini SRC) consisting of a simple RISC processor, memory, and I/O. This project was created for an engineering course at Queen's University. Please feel free to look at the work, but DO NOT COPY IT DIRECTLY, especially if you are taking this course.
